=begin
- Understanding the Problem
  - Goal: understand what you're being asked to do
  - Establish to rules/define the boundaries of the problem
  - What are the explicit and implicit requirements?
  - Ask clarifying questions (& check test cases) 

- Examples and Test Cases
  - Goal: understand more about what you're being asked to do 
  - Use these to confirm or refute assumptions
  - A good way to see the rules/boundaries but in actual code

- Data Structures
  - Goal: begin to think logically and solution-based about the problem
  - How we structure our data is closely related to our algorithm/how we want to go about solving our problem
  - Helps us reason with data more logically
  - What does our data look like when we get it? (input)
  - What does our data look like when we return it? (output?)
  - What does our data need to look like in between, or will it be the same?

- Algorithms
  - Goal: write out high level steps to solve the given problem
  - A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Be abstract and high level (don't box yourself in)
  - You are programming-language-agnostic right now
  - Find a solution that works (don't worry about efficiency for now)
  - Can create substeps for different parts
  - Can even separate concerns into a helper method
  - You can (and should) return to your algorithm during the implementation stage to update
  
- Implementing a Solution in Code
  - Goal: translate the algorithm into your programming language of choice (Ruby)
  - Now is the time to use pseudo code (if you want) to act as a step between the algorithm and actual code
  - Goal of Pseudo Code: to explore the solution in the programming language
  - Then: follow the algorithm and code the solution
  - If you find that your algorithm doesn't work, return there FIRST and THEN fix your code
  - Good programmers often spend the least amount of time in this step, because they figured everything out in the other steps

get string set to 'mixed'

split 'mixed' and set to an array

read value of 'mixed' array

return integers from array and set to

=begin
Implement a method that calculates the sum of the integers inside a string. E.g. "L12aun3ch Sch3oo45l"

Note: only positive integers will be tested.

# PROBLEM
- input: string with letters and numbers
- output: integer
- boundaries: all integers will be positive
- "12" -> is that 12 or 1 + 2?
- calculate the sum of the integers in the input string
- "L12aun3ch Sch3oo45l" -> example input
- create a method

# EXAMPLES
p sum_of_integers("HE2LL3O W1OR5LD") == 11
p sum_of_integers("The30quick20brown10f0x1203jumps914ov3r1349the102l4zy dog") == 3635
p sum_of_integers("HELLO WORLD!") == 0
p sum_of_integers("HELLO WORLD77!") == 77

0 -> zero
O -> oh
1 -> one
l -> llama
- consecutive digits are considered one integer: "12" is 12
- output: integer
- if no integers in string, return 0
- we only have to deal with alphanumeric characters AND spaces and exclamation points

DATA STRUCTURES
- strings (splitting them later?)
- integers
  - setting the default return as 0
- array (parsing the string, split and join strings later on)
- range (to find valid numbers)

ALGORITHM
Aryan

GIVEN a String including alphanumeric characters AND spaces and exclamation points
  - Split string into array where every character is contained in individual block
  - create an Integer which counts the total of the sum of the integers called total
 
Create a loop which goes through each element of the array
  - if element is not numeric 
    - go to NEXT iteration of loop
  - if element is numeric:
    - create a subloop which checks how many subsequent elements are numeric and concatenates these together into one integer
    - add integer to total



-----------------------------------------------------
Luke

ALGORITHM
- Given an input string `str`
- Initialize an empty array `arr`
- Initialize a variable `int` as an empty string
- Loop through all characters of `str` where each charater is `char`
  - Skip if `char` is not an integer
  - If `char` is an integer, append `char` to `int`
  - Append integer to `arr` when you meet another non-integer
  - Set `int` to an empty string again
- Sum all integers in `arr`
- Return sum

get string set to 'mixed'

split 'mixed' and set to an array

read value of 'mixed' array

-----------------------------------------------------
James

set 'integers' variable equal to range 0 to 9
set 'digits' variable equal to empty array

create a 'counter' variable equal to the length of input string

call 'loop' method using counter and input string as arguments

'loop' method:
create a loop that runs until 'counter' equals length of string argument
set 'char' variable equal to empty string
iterate through characters in the string using counter as index
if character converted to integer is within the range variable 
  add to 'char' string variable
  increment counter by 1 and loop again
otherwise
  increment counter by 1 and outer loop again

create 'sum' variable
iterate through 'digits' array
convert element strings to ingteers
increment 'sum'

-----------------------------------------------------
Andy

define method name = ask if tester has a preference. take one parameter = (string)
take string input and split up into two arrays.
  array one has all the non numeric numbers (HELLO WORLD)
  array two has integers as their own index.(2, 3, 1, 5)
    if consecutive digit, part of same integer. (ex. 77)
  add up the integers in the array.
  if 2nd array is empty, output is 0
  return the output as an integer.
end method

Callie

- accept a str as argument
- create a sum and set it to 0 
- create an empty string for the current number
- break the string apart and look at each character
  - if the character is a number
    - add it to the end of the current number
  - if the character is not a number
    - add the current number to sum
    - reset current number
- return the sum
